This repo is having very basic CTF challeneges which can tried by anyone who is very new to cybersec.

What is CTF?

CTF (Capture The Flag) is a kind of information security competition that challenges contestants to solve a variety of tasks ranging from a scavenger hunt on wikipedia to basic programming exercises, to hacking your way into a server to steal data. In these challenges, the contestant is usually asked to find a specific piece of text that may be hidden on the server or behind a webpage. This goal is called the flag, hence the name!



Challenge types

CTFs challenges are typically divided into categories. I'll try to briefly cover the common ones.

    Cryptography - Typically involves decrypting or encrypting a piece of data
    Steganography - Tasked with finding information hidden in files or images
    Binary - Reverse engineering or exploiting a binary file
    Web - Exploiting web pages to find the flag
    Pwn - Exploiting a server to find the flag
